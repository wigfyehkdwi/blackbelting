The black belt project or something

So the idea is to write a game that uses SDL and might be written in C or C++. ~~No idea what it will be about. It might use pixelated art like the Minesweeper clone from earlier though. It will be a 2D game with some form of world.~~

Here I decided to start with an old idea I partially remember. This will be a game about a flying squirrel. Said squirrel can glide from tree to tree and potentially other destinations. This squirrel will be able to interact with other animals, RPG-style I suppose.

I'm not sure what the conflict of the game will be, but I have some ideas. As suggested by other students, the squirrel's habitat might be threatened by humans, and the objective of the game could be to fight them. Alternatively, the squirrel might be in search of something special.
